Product & Engineering
Udacity experience with React Native (3rd July 2018)
Distinctions in styling for iOS and Android require separate integration points. Fine if styling common (icons, back button), but complexity when introducing retrospectively.
Seems like the problem arises when you treat the shared code as an opportunity to disregard differences in platform. Internationalisation on Android proved a problem, with regards to different screen sizes (this isn’t a surprise). String localization required the setting up of separate repos (we should anticipate this).
“[we needed] a great deal of bridging code to communicate between native and React Native components”
Android/Gradle build tooling being in conflict with React Native (resource)
Documentation: “As React Native has continued to evolve, the documentation and supporting community contributions have improved. It’s likely that if we were starting today, we would have been able find answers to some of our questions more easily.”
“With a small team, and limited bandwidth, if it wasn’t an easy/quick fix in the React Native code it had a much lower likelihood of being addressed because of the additional development effort it might require.” Bug detection not always easy.
Design: “One specific example of this is using text/margin values that are consistent with the rest of the native applications”

Opportunity Zones (USA) 
Written by sbertoni@forbes.com
Where investors can put taxable capital gains
Investors who sell assets have 180 days to plow their taxable capital gains into an approved opportunity fund, which must hold 90% of its assets in Opportunity Zone projects. 
For a census tract to qualify as an O-zone, it must have a poverty rate of 20% or higher or a median household income that is less than 80% of the surrounding area. Governors are allowed to designate 25% of their states' eligible tracts as O-zones. In all, about 8,700 areas, ranging from rusty industrial towns to dusty rural hamlets, have been approved.

Leapfrogging in Africa (FT)
In Ghana, Cocoa Link delivers information to farmers via text message, dispensing practical advice and market prices. In Kenya, Twiga Foods, an online marketplace, uses technology to disintermediate thousands of wholesalers and ensure a transparent market for farmers. Grant Brooke, Twiga’s chief executive, says the greater certainty provided by mobile-based technology can help farmers raise yields. // In Ghana, Cocoa Link delivers information to farmers via text message, dispensing practical advice and market prices.

Why Midsized Metro areas deserve our attention (Brookings)

Altogether, 68 million people—or one in four Americans—live in one of the nation’s 135 midsized metro areas. While that’s only a little more than one-third the number of people who live in large metro areas (183 million), it’s far more than the number who live in smaller metro areas with populations under 250,000 (29 million), or even the 46 million “rural” Americans who live outside metro areas altogether (Figure 2). Midsized metro areas range in population from Yakima, Wash. (250,200) to Tulsa, Okla. (990,700). Although these regions lack the size and global reach of their much larger metro counterparts, they arguably retain the requisite scale to offer a distinctive economy and quality of life to their businesses and residents. Moreover, their size may also facilitate the sort of pragmatic, cross-sector problem solving that often bedevils larger metro areas; to wit, the average midsized metro area encompasses just 2.8 U.S. counties, versus 8.2 counties in the average large metro area.

Addressing Skill Gaps (SHRM)

Tanya Axenson, global head of human resources for Allegis Group, recommended that HR identify the core competencies needed for any job. "The question is, how much of that must someone possess when they sit in the chair on day one versus how much can be trained or taught?" she asked. "With the way jobs are changing more quickly, we're finding that more organizations are willing to hire for the core and make sure that the person has the necessary soft skills to navigate the workplace, and then train for the rest."

What is needed however is clear and accurate information about specific career paths at a far more granular level than that provided by the National Careers Service. It will also need to be able to support firms (see Section 4) as well as individuals. While of course this should not be driven by very specific predictions of the types of jobs that will blossom, it can illustrate bigger trends and signpost established progression routes.
